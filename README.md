Simply run the files in VS Code.

Before running try to understand how the code works :D

The test cases are below.

Sample Testcase:

Starting Node: 523 
Ending Node:   5229

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Shortest Distance: 115
Path: [523, 18631, 28318, 38056, 30570, 30312, 21052, 1185, 32946, 25234, 39811, 13076, 35687, 39727, 5229]

 A* Algorithm:

Shortest Distance: 116
Path: [523, 18631, 18158, 39300, 38482, 10851, 25687, 37791, 29925, 34632, 13077, 5229]

Longest Chain of Influence: (This is for the whole graph)

Longest Chain Length: 18

User Sequence: [6595, 14063, 3243, 21070, 1389, 1392, 21445, 26187, 9799, 212, 28661, 11490, 20021, 35737, 21394, 9318, 20614, 1860]
